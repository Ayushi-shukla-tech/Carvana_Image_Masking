# Carvana_Image_Masking
In this competition, we had been challenged to develop an algorithm that automatically removes the photo studio background. This will allow Carvana to superimpose cars on a variety of backgrounds. I have analyzed a dataset of photos, covering different vehicles with a wide variety of year, make, and model combinations.
# Conclusion
After rigorous experimentation and evaluation, I successfully attained results with TransUNet with dilated layers, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%, alongside remarkable Dice and IOU scores exceeding 97%.
